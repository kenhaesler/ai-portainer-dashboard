This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Cody, etc.) working with this repository.

**All project rules, architecture, and conventions are defined in `CLAUDE.md`.** This file exists as a pointer — the rules are identical across all AI tools. Read and follow `CLAUDE.md` completely.
